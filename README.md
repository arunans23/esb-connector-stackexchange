# esb-connector-stackexchange

The StackExchange [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI640/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [StackExchange REST API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs) 
through WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). StackExchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in 
diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation 
award process. The reputation system allows the sites to be self-moderating.

## Getting started
